# Huffman Code
Implementation of the algorithm (building the code and encoding the input) that is used in lossless data compression.
* Huffman Code is an interactive program that is used to build a variable length code to different input character(s) with time complexity of O(n*log(n)).
* The length of code is related to how frequently characters are used.
* Due to the use of Hash function to store generated codes in array, the encoding is consistent at O(n) where n is the number of characters in the input. 

## Programming Language Used
* Java
## Future Enhancements 
* The efficiency of encoding can be improved significantly to O(n*log(n)) by using a Heap structure to store the code built from algorithm.
